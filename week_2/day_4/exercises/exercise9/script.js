// Exercise 9 : Vacations Costs
// Instructions
// Let’s create functions that calculate your vacation’s costs:

// Define a function called hotelCost().
// It should ask the user for the number of nights they would like to stay in the hotel.
// If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a number, ask again.
// The hotel costs $140 per night. The function should return the total price of the hotel.
// Define a function called planeRideCost().
// It should ask the user for their destination.
// The function should return a different price depending on the location.
// “London”: 183$
// “Paris” : 220$
// All other destination : 300$
// If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a string, ask again.
// Define a function called rentalCarCost().
// It should ask the user for the number of days they would like to rent the car.
// If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a number, ask again.
// Calculate the cost to rent the car. The car costs $40 everyday.
// If the user rents a car for more than 10 days, they get a 5% discount.
// The function should return the total price of the car rental.
// Define a function called totalVacationCost() that returns the total cost of the user’s vacation by calling the 3 functions that you created above.
// Example : The car cost: $x, the hotel cost: $y, the plane tickets cost: $z.
// Hint: You have to call the functions hotelCost(), planeRideCost() and rentalCarCost() inside the function totalVacationCost.
// Call the function totalVacationCost()
// Bonus: Instead of using a prompt inside the 3 first functions, only use a prompt inside the totalVacationCost() function.
